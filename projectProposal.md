# Project Proposal

## Overview
GigOffice is focused on bringing the level of employment transparency available to traditionally employed workers, to gig workers. Currently, such information is either disseminated at-will by the gig employer or discussed between workers in social groups. What we think would be helpful for gig workers would be a centralized, community-driven source of income and compensation information similar to Glassdoor, or levels.fyi. The relative newness of the gig economy as well as the highly fluctuating nature of gig income is likely why no such site exists yet. We want to learn more about the current state of employment information spread among gig workers, and gauge the interest of gig workers, specifically rideshare drivers in the scope of this study, in having such a tool. There are many different avenues of information that can be disseminated, such as current average job earnings or long term benefits such as insurance deals, and we would like to solidify what the workers themselves would most like to know. We would also like to learn what the best form of this tool would be, and what additional features the workers would like. GigOffice is intended first to empower gig workers to gain the most out of their work, and ultimately for gig work to gain the same social, economic and legal legitimacy as traditional employment.

## Data Collection
### Collection Methods
To collect our data, we decided to use an online survey (Google Forms) method, seen in Appendix A. This will allow the data collected to be automatically linked to an excel spreadsheet, making the transition to data analysis seamless.

Our current focus is on Uber and Lyft drivers. While the gig economy encompasses a large number of services and firms, we decided it would be best to focus on rideshare to narrow down our analysis to a specific population. Given that our initial designs and analyses are promising, our research would be able to be expanded to other arenas in the gig economy. We will be distributing our survey to Uber and Lyft drivers by already existing community platforms. These include Facebook groups (Uber and Lyft Drivers in Chicago), and Reddit threads (we will pay a small advertisement fee to recruit survey participants in this case). 

While a structured interview would provide more depth into specific driver experiences, we decided upon a survey for a couple reasons. First, interviews are more time consuming and intensive for participants, and would decrease the number of users we can gather data from. Because we are aiming to create a platform to benefit the general rideshare driver, we prioritized the number of data points over the depth of the qualitative data. Furthermore, the data we wish to collect can be formatted into simple checkbox questions with an option to elaborate on other answers we have not provided if desired. We also have limited access to our target user population unless we utilize a wider platform and provide a survey that can be completed from the user’s own devices. As students, we do not have funding to travel to interview, and our natural interactions with drivers are scarce. By providing a survey, we will be able to reach many more individuals who can complete the study in their own time and space.

We cannot compensate all participants for sharing their experiences. However, to provide a form of incentive, we decided to leave an option to enter one’s emails to be entered in a raffle for a $20 Amazon gift card.

### Survey Content
Our survey questions can be divided into 3 categories, which can be seen in Appendix A. First, we ask questions about the driver’s expectations and knowledge about working in the gig economy prior to becoming a worker for a rideshare platform. We include options including compensation, expenses, and ask whether their expectations matched their experiences. In the second section we ask questions about the information transparency once the participant started driving for the gig economy. Similar to the first part, we ask about compensation, expenses, and ask about additional things they would like to know. Finally, the third section focuses on their communication with the rideshare driver population. We ask what platforms they use to communicate with other drivers (if at all), what they talk about, and what they wished they could talk about.

After completing the survey, users will be directed to another optional form. Here, they can enter they emails if they would like to enter the raffle for a \$20 Amazon gift card, or if they would be willing to be contacted later on to share further experiences. We hope to gain at least 20 responses on the survey. There are no long answers required and the survey should take roughly 10 minutes or less to complete. Depending on the number of responses we gain and their qualities, we may reach out to participants who leave their emails for a more in-depth analysis and collect more data.

### Data Analysis
As mentioned, our survey only contains straight forward multiple choice or checkbox questions, with an “Other” option that allows participants to go into more detail about answer choices we may have not provided. The responses will be linked to a spreadsheet, which we will use for analysis.

First, we will quantitatively analyze the user’s choices. This will include analyzing the choices that were selected the most by the participants, and creating graphs, charts, or other visual aids to observe patterns and highlights in the data.

For “Other” choices that the participants typed in themselves, we will adopt a thematic coding approach. We will go through the first half or so of the responses to create an initial codebook of thematic words represented by these choices. Then, we will code the data collected based on this codebook, tweaking themes as we see fit.

We will consolidate themes across typed answers and chosen answers, and analyze which themes are the most consistent across participants. We are also interested to see which themes are not as important to drivers. These results will guide us in deciding what information we want to include on our platform, what we need to prioritize, and what we want to leave out.

## User Characteristics
We'll be focusing specifically on Uber and Lyft drivers ("Drivers") for the purpose of this study.

We chose to study Drivers for this study for two main reasons. First off, there are lots of them - more than five million in the United States alone (https://therideshareguy.com/how-many-uber-drivers-are-ther). Their quantity leads us to our second point: because there are so many, Drivers already have basic forms of labor organization. There are Facebook groups (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1667751810150637), sub-Reddits (https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/), and blogs (https://therideshareguy.com) dedicated to Driver organization and information sharing, which in turn indicates that this demographic is interested in labor organization and information sharing.

In terms of basic demographic facts, the following characteristics are particularly pertinent to this study:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every Driver is at least 21 years old
    \item Every Driver has access to a smart phone
    \item The entire Driver population has a high degree of socioeconomic diversity. Studies show that, on aggregate, Uber drivers average \$11.77 an hour (https://www.epi.org/publication/uber-and-the-labor-market-uber-drivers-compensation-wages-and-the-scale-of-uber-and-the-gig-economy). For the full-time driver that's barely a livable wage; for the part-time driver, that's a decent income supplement
    \item Drivers have very limited spare time during the work day due to company policies regarding ride frequencies
    \item Drivers are weary of exploitation. Uber and Lyft company policy often blatantly favors management or riders over drivers, so Drivers are often skeptical
\end{enumerate}

Those characteristics have the following effects on our study:
    * 21 years old: No tangible effect
    * Smart phone access: Our system should be mobile compatible
    * Economically vulnerable: We should not offer grandiose incentives to partake in our study
    * Pressed for time: Any survey we send out should be short and to-the-point
    * Skeptical: We need to take special care to establish trust with our users
    
## User Tasks
Most of our users (gig economy workers) have the goal of either making their entire living, or simply some extra money, using apps like Uber and Lyft. That being said, the current situation in the gig economy provides workers with a very small amount of information about their expected earnings. For example, an Uber driver in Chicago can expect to make 0.67 cents for each mile they drive. However, this figure is not advertised publicly anywhere on the Uber website, and comes from an individual driver averaging their own earnings and mileage. They are unaware how much the rider pays per mile, how much the city of Chicago earns per mile (from taxes & fees), and how much Uber earns per mile. In this situation, Uber drivers in Chicago do not know whether they’re getting 0.67 cents for each dollar the rider pays or they’re getting 0.67 cents for every five dollars the rider pays.

Users also have to deal with indirect costs (not associated with fares) like car maintenance and gas. Our platform will enable users to upload information this type of information for a better understanding of what sort of vehicle is most appropriate for the most profit. For example, it may help answer whether it is better to buy a budget car and complete as many trips as possible, or if it is better to buy a luxury car and complete trips for premium services like uberBLACK.

Our solution seeks to make this information more transparent to potential workers for each of the gig economy platforms. By creating a single place for drivers to upload their earnings per ride, each driver can see exactly how much they can expect to make and calculate their expected earnings. Drivers can also upload their fees & charges to gain a better idea about what may be docked from their total earnings. Users will be able to search for compensation data by various relevant filters (tenure at firm, geography, time of day, etc.) in order to make sure only the most relevant information is presented.
	
Our users will spend most of their day driving their cars, which is a stressful and focus-intensive environment. It is highly unlikely that drivers will want to sit down at the end of a long day and manually enter their earnings into our platform. So, our goal is to automate the earnings submission process as much as possible. One way to accomplish this is by running a mobile app in the background that collects accelerometer data and learns to detect patterns corresponding to starting / stopping rides. When the Driver starts driving, she lets the app know, and then when she finishes rides the app prompts her to enter compensation information and trip details. That way, the driver can easily submit data without the app tracking any sort of meaningfully identifiable data. Of course, this feature would be optional, and the app would also support manual entry separate from any driving activities.

## Existing Systems
Current platforms like Glassdoor and Levels.fyi deliver community-driven job information to users, for free. Levels.fyi is focused on salary with breakdown by employee level while Glassdoor also gathers employee ratings and reviews, and connects users directly to job opportunities. Neither have information available for gig workers. For one, this is because income information is not salaried/hourly like regular jobs. But this could also be due to typical treatment of gig services as side hustle instead of a main line of work that requires intensive job benefits research.

In lieu of a centralized information exchange platform, users have taken to their own means of connecting. This is most prominent in social media groups such as Facebook and Reddit, where users exchange information about best practices, to discuss problems such as benefits or legal issues, and to swap stories about their work. The main issue with these social media groups is that they are very general-purpose and are not localized enough to provide very much helpful information for drivers to maximize their income. Another issue is that access to these groups requires existing social media presence, which especially cuts out older demographics.

There are also blogs or YouTube channels that give advice on gig driving. For example, The Rideshare Guy (https://therideshareguy.com) is blog operated by several writers who discuss the latest developments in gig services, and advice curated from the writers’ experience and contributing readers. This is similar to what one would find for a specialized blog in other careers. However, they still fall short of being able to report actual achievable income and how to maximize it. The future landscape of the gig community could be a crowdsourced income information platform like ours supplementing advice and news from outlets like The Rideshare Guy.

## Relevant Literature
Currently, there exists a dearth of existing research on creating actual centralized platforms for gig economy workers. As mentioned in the previous section, existing systems are limited in their options for gig economy workers, or simply leave them out. However, literature does exist to support the purpose of this research. We will discuss the need for information transparency and centralization in the gig economy, specifically rideshare applications such as Uber and Lyft. In addition, we will discuss the benefits of driver communication in the rideshare environment.

Gig economy workers for Uber and Lyft are technically not considered “employees”, but rather independent contractors. One of the main complaints of workers in the rideshare economy is that the firms tend to take advantage of this specific situation (Greenhouse, 2016). John Billington during an interview in “Uber: On the Road to Nowhere” states that “They treat us like employees, but we get none of the benefits. They’re telling us what rides we have to pick up. They dictate fares. We don’t get a say in what the fares will be. They keep close track on your ratings, and they threaten to deactivate you over various things.” Billington is not covered by workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance, or health insurance, and doesn’t receive paid vacation/sick days or holidays. In addition, UCLA Professor Katherine Stone believes that “the reason they don’t want these workers to be employees is they want to stop a union” (Greenhouse, 2016). While lawsuits against Uber to have drivers designated as employees have been made (Greenhouse, 2016), there are many complications that come along with this proposition that does not provide a solid solution for the current moment. We believe that even in the absence of a union, communication among drivers is still the central theme that will be able to better the work lives of rideshare drivers. By providing and receiving the information they want, such as ability to predict fares and how to keep their ratings up (as Billington mentioned), drivers will be more informed to generate feasible and effective work schedules and patterns.

A key statement in Billington’s testimony is that Uber dictates fares, and drivers are kept in the dark about what how much they can earn in a given day. This is further complicated by the fact that Uber’s prices are constantly changing. First, there is the obvious fluctuation as Uber decides to increase or decrease prices in general. Billington says that in his first year, he grossed $1500 to $2000 a week, but it has now become $700 to $800 a week (Greenhouse, 2016). There is also a dynamic surge pricing as a factor of an algorithm which “automatically raises the price of a trip when demand outstrips supply… trip prices are adjusted by multiplying the prices of underlying components… the base fare, the price per mile, and the price per minute - by a multiplier output by the surge algorithm” (Chen & Sheldon, 2015). Aggregation of this data, along with the conditions during the surge period,  allows for drivers to infer when the best times to drive would be. Knowing these general patterns would allow drivers to make better plans for their future.

Furthermore, drivers spend a large sum of their pay to support the work they do. Billington spends $120 a week on gas, in addition to the cost of insurance, a weekly car wash, a monthly oil change, and the depreciation on his vehicle (Greenhouse, 2016). It is beneficial for drivers to be able to communicate with each other to find the least expensive ways to maintain their vehicles and other factors to maximize their income.

Finally, as mentioned before, the act of communication between drivers allows them to discuss their rights together, and understand how they are being treated unfairly. One driver alone could assume that they simply had a bad day when they do not make much, or that this compensation pattern is how it always was. However, talking to veterans like Billington or seeing the data presented could bring the group together to take action for their rights. In 2014, Uber drivers came together to protest against low fares, tipping policies, rating systems, and driver safety (Shokoohyar, 2018). Drivers can also give advice to each other on maintaining a reasonable operating cost, and dealing with bad riders to maintain ratings in the system. 

Rideshare drivers agree in the benefits they have with the gig economy, such as high levels of flexibility and autonomy. However, working alone in the gig economy has been seen to result in low pay, social isolation, working unsocial and irregular hours, overwork, sleep deprivation, and exhaustion (Wood et al., 2018). By providing an online “office space” for gig economy workers, we hold that the centralized information will allow them to maximize their income and working conditions, while feeling a sense of community with other drivers.

## Initial Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate our eventual design with two main goals in mind: 1) seamless information upload without taking away from the user’s productivity and 2) provide users with information that is important and relevant. We will ask users to rate the information collection stage on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being useless and cumbersome and 10 being quick and easy. Similarly, we will ask users to rate the information presentation stage on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being unhelpful information and 10 being useful.
	
In addition, we will attempt to design a UI in accordance with Norman’s 7 design principles. We want to make sure that our design does a good job at presenting affordances appropriately (i.e. users can quickly understand that our background app is meant to collect information passively). We also want to ensure discoverability and signifiers to allow users to quickly figure out how to navigate through the UI. We want to make sure there is appropriate feedback for when a ride has been successfully recorded in our background app, as well as provide a clear conceptual model on how information goes from completing a ride to being presented. We also want users to know about possible constraints (e.g. requirement for access to an internet-enabled device).
